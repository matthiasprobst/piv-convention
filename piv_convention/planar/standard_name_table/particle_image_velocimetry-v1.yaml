table:
  final_interrogation_window_size:
    alias: interrogation_window_size
    canonical_units: pixel
    description: Size of the final PIV interogation window.
  image_particle_density:
    canonical_units: 1/pixel
    description: Number of particle images per pixel. Equals the number of particles
      divided by the image area.
  image_particle_diameter:
    canonical_units: pixel
    description: The diameter of an image particle.
  inplane_velocity:
    canonical_units: m/s
    description: Velocity is a vector quantity. Without a prefix "x", "y" or "z" it
      indicates the magnitute of the velocity vector. "inplane" indicates that the
      velocity magnitude was computed based on the in-plane components only.
